# Deciding the Next Film Project: Romance vs Horror

## 📚 Project Overview
As part of an MSc Data Science assignment, I took on the role of a data scientist at a fictional film production company. The company's last movie was a box office failure, and the CEO has called for data-driven insights to guide the next production decision.

The challenge: **Should the next movie be a Romance or a Horror film?**  
In addition, I was tasked with recommending:
the best **director** and **actor(s)**

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare **Romance** and **Horror** genres using IMDB data
- Provide summary statistics based on IMDb score, for the top performing genres
- Recommend a genre, director, and actor based on the CEO's desire to make a high-IMDb-scoring film

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset provided was a cleaned version of the publically available IMDb datasets

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Data cleaning 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis testing (1-tailed t-test)

## 📊 Key Findings
- Romance films have a higher average IMDb score than Horror films

## ✅ Recommendations
Based on the data analysis:
- **Genre**: Romance
- **Recommended Director**: Woody Allen
- **Recommended Actor**: Anna Kendrick and J.K. Simmons

These recommendations are based on quantitative evidence from historical performance metrics such as average ratings and popularity (vote counts).
