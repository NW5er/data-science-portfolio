# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio — a curated collection of projects, some of which were completed as part of my MSc in Data Science. These projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data storytelling using real-world datasets.

## 📂 What's Inside

Each folder in this repository contains an individual project with:
- 📓 A Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis or model
- 📄 A README summarizing the project and key findings
- 📁 Supporting files such as datasets or reports

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preprocessing messy datasets
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing data insights
- **Statistical Modelling**: Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, inference and interpretation
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning (classification, regression), model evaluation
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Pytorch`, and more...
- **Communication**: Visual storytelling, structured reports, clear recommendations

## 🧪 Sample Projects
| Project | Description |
